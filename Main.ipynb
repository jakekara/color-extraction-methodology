    "This notebook demonstrates the use of [margo-loader](https://github.com/margo-notebooks/margo-loader-py) to use Notebooks as source code modules. As a result, we can organize the code into small, manageable notebooks that each do one thing, and then coordinate them into this notebook. \n",

    "The goal is to allow you to better understand each individual part of the notebook as well as how the parts work together as one system.\n",
    "\n",
    "An added benefit is that while we only use one color extraction algorithm in the final data pipeline, we wrote code implementations of several color extraction algorithms. Each algorithm has its own notebook with sample outputs, so you can see how well each algorithm works and choose the one that works best for your images."
